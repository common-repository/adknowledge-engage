== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is an Affiliate ID and API Key? =

Your Affiliate ID and API Key are unique to you as a publisher in the Adknowledge Engage platform. The plugin will not work without these two keys being correctly entered.

= Why do I have to signup and enter my domain? =

Registering your domain URL is required by the Adknowledge Engage platform. In combination with your Affliate ID and API Key, your domain will enable our recommendation engine to determine and display the recommendations on your website.

= Can I control what pages are shown in recommendations? =

Yes. You can provide the URL to your sitemap.xml file, and we will prioritize these URLs in our recommendation algorithm. We highly recommend utilizing this feature. In addition, if there is a specific URL you wish to see removed, please email us at engagesupport@adknowledge.com with these URLs, and we will assist removing these from your recommendation list. We also do our best to ensure that your archive pages are not recommended to a user.

= What are paid links? =

Paid links, like all recommendations, are links to content that Adknowledge customers have paid to distribute alongside our recommendations. Our team regularly reviews these links to ensure we only select quality content to recommend to your readers.

= Can I get paid for these paid recommendations? =

Yes, any website or Publisher that agrees to our Terms and Conditions is eligible to display, and be paid, for these links - we do not require a minimum number of page views or unique visitors.

= I am not seeing recommendation. =

Our system takes time to index and determine the recommendations for your content. This can, at times, take as long as a few hours. If you don't see any recommendations or ratings after a few hours, please check to ensure that you've added the domain you are expecting to see recommendations on to your account. Once confirmed, please check that you have the correct Affiliate ID and API key entered in the plugin interface (if your keys do not verify, you do not have the correct Affiliate ID and/or API key). If you are still having issues, please contact us at engagesupport@adknowledge.com, and we will assist in determining the cause and help you get going.

= Can I change how the recommendations work? =

By default, Adknowledge Engage inherits the look and feel of your site "out of the box." If you'd like to change it further, you can control some CSS elements directly in the WordPress plugin settings interface, or by adding and editing the following lines of CSS directly in your own CSS file. If you still need help, please contact us at engagesupport@adknowledge.com and we will try our best to assist.
